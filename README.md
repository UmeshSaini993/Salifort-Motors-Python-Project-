# Salifort Motors Machine Learning Project

## Project Descriotion

The HR department of the Salifort Motors had taken initiatives to improve employee satisfaction levels at the company. The project aims to analyze the data collected by the company and provide data-driven suggestions. Further, a ML model was supposed to be built to predict whether an employee will leave the company or not based on different variables such as total number of hours worked, number of project completed, whether promoted or not, etc. The most important feature contributing towards prediction were required to be identified. 

## Key Insights on EDA

1. Workload and long working hours were related to employees leaving the company.
   
3. This indicates all employees working longer hours and with higher performance evaluations were leaving the company.
   
5. Employees who have not been promoted, worked a higher number of hours.
   
7. Promotion played a part in employees' satisfaction level and hence may contribute to them leaving the company.

## Machine Learning Algorithms

1. An iteration of different ML Models was undertaken which included Logistic regression, Naive Bayes Model, Decision Tree, Random Forest and XG Boost. F1 SCore was considered the relevent metrics to analyse and choose the best machine learning model.  

3. The XG Boost model has performed better than all other models with an accuracy of 98.36% and F1 score of 94.96%. 
The average number of monthly hours is the most important feature to develop the predictive model. 

4. This model helped predict whether an employee will leave the company or not and identify the most influential factors. These insights can help HR make decisions to improve employee retention.


## Recommendations to HR Team
     
1. Cap the number of projects that employees can work on.

2. Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for at least four years, or conduct further investigation on  why four-year tenured employees are so dissatisfied.

3. Either reward employees for working longer hours, or don't require them to do so.

4. High evaluation scores should not be reserved for employees who work 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding employees who contribute more/put in more effort.
